# . Create a class named Notes for handling text-based file operations. Class 
# should contain methods "write", "read" and then "append" as instance 
# methods or class methods. (Can contain any other methods if you wish) 
# Use a single file for saving the notes. You can set the file name as a constant 
# somewhere in the program (Or as a class variable). write method should 
# create the if it doesn't exist, Then it should overwrite the older contents 
# with the user input if the user plans to overwrite the file. read method 
# should read the whole file contents and return it. If the file doesn't exist, 
# then it should return "No notes found" append method should take the 
# user input value and it must add the value to the end of the file. It must not 
# overwrite the file. Now create a program to utilize this class.  
# The program should repeatedly ask the user for these 4 choices :  
# 1 - Write Note (Overwrite existing).  
# 2 - Add more Notes (Append).  
# 3 - Read Notes.  
# 4 â€“ Exit
